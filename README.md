# üìö Quizly - Online Quiz Platform

Quizly is an online quiz platform where **admins** create **users & teachers**, who in turn create quizzes for students. Students can take quizzes based on their enrolled courses.

## **üöÄ First-Time Setup & Initialization**

When you **run the project for the first time**, the following steps automatically occur:

1. **Admin User is Created**

   - A default **admin user** is generated with credentials from `.env` file.
   - The admin is responsible for managing teachers, students, and quizzes.

2. **Default Course is Created**

   - A sample course named `"sample"` with code `"1001"` is added to the database.

3. **Teacher & Student Accounts are Created**

   - A **teacher** (`teacher1`) is linked to the default course.
   - A **student** (`student2`) is also linked to the default course.

4. **A Sample Quiz is Created**
   - A **quiz** with 10 sample questions is created for the default course.
